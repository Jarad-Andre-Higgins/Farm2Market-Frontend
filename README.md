# Farm2Market Frontend

## Project Structure

The Farm2Market frontend consists of the following key pages:

1. **Landing Page** (`landing-page.html`): Marketing-focused page for new visitors
2. **Home Page** (`index.html`): Main site homepage for returning users
3. **Farmer Section**: Pages for farmers to register, manage listings, etc.
4. **Buyer Section**: Pages for buyers to register, browse products, etc.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure all assets are in place (see Assets section below)
3. Open any HTML file in a browser to view locally

## Assets Required

The following assets should be placed in the `/assets` folder:

- `logo.png`: Farm2Market logo
- `hero-bg.jpg`: Background image for hero section
- `cta-bg.jpg`: Background image for call-to-action section
- `farmer-testimonial.jpg`: Image for farmer testimonial
- `buyer-testimonial.jpg`: Image for buyer testimonial
- `og-image.jpg`: Open Graph image for social sharing

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the CSS for mobile responsiveness**
2. **Create the Farmer and Buyer registration pages**
3. **Implement language switching functionality**
4. **Connect to backend API endpoints**
5. **Add product listing and browsing functionality**

## File Organization

- `/js`: JavaScript files
- `/assets`: Images and other static assets
- `/Farmer`: Farmer-specific pages
- `/Buyer`: Buyer-specific pages

=======
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
